yhea, about this....
there's no much to explain actually
use it if you want to...
I'm still kinda working on it
and yeah, there's a problem when you try to do 70mm x 70mm images, I'm working around it
thanks for trying this shiet, much aprecieted

I know all the code is in only one file and the other seems not to work at all
I just wanted to keep it simple
I'll probably upload a new one where JavaScript and CSS are detached from the main file. but this way you just need one file and nothing else

// this readme only exist because GitHub ask me to
